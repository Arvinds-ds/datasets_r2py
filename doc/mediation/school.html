<h2>School-level data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The original data source is the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002. To deal with the issue on individually identifiable information, we generated hypothetical student-level data using a multiple imputation method. The Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 used a two-stage sample selection process. First, a national sample of schools was selected using stratified probability proportional to size (PPS), and school contacting resulted in 1,221 eligible public, Catholic, and other private schools from a population of approximately 27,000 schools containing 10th grade students. Of the eligible schools, 752 participated in the study. In the second stage of sample selection, a sample of approximately 26 sophomores, from within each of the participating public and private schools was selected. Each school was asked to provide a list of 10th grade students, and quality assurance (QA) checks were performed on each list that was received.</p>
