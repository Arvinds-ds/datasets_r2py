<h3>Details</h3>

  
<p>Researchers investigated
whether financial incentives would help people lose weight more successfully. Some participants in
the study were randomly assigned to a treatment group that was offered financial incentives for
achieving weight loss goals, while others were assigned to a control group that did not use financial
incentives. All participants were monitored over a four month period and the net weight change
(Before - After in pounds) at the end of this period was recorded for each individual. Then the
individuals were left alone for three months with a followup weight check at the seven-month mark
to see whether weight losses persisted after the original four months of treatment. This dataset has only
the non-missing 7-month data.  The 4-month data are in WeightLossIncentive4 and both measurements (including
missing values) are in WeightLossIncentive.
