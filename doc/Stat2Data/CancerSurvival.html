<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the 1970's doctors wondered if giving terminal cancer patients a supplement of ascorbate would
prolong their lives. They designed an experiment to compare cancer patients who received ascorbate
to cancer patients who did not receive the supplement. The result of that experiment was that, in
fact, ascorbate did seem to prolong the lives of these patients. But then a second question arose.
Was the effect of the ascorbate different when different organs were affected by the cancer? The
researchers took a second look at the data. This time they concentrated only on those patients who
received the ascorbate and divided the data up by which organ was affected by the cancer. They
had 5 different organs represented among the patients (all of whom only had one organ affected):
Stomach, bronchus, colon, ovary, and breast.
