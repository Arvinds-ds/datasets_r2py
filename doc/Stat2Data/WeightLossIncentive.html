<h2>WeightLossIncentive</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An experiment to see if financial incentives improve weight loss
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A dataset with 38 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<table summary="Rd table">
<tr>
 <td style="text-align: right;">
    <code>WeightLoss</code></td><td style="text-align: left;"> Weight loss (in pounds) after four months</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td style="text-align: right;">
    <code>Group</code></td><td style="text-align: left;"> Treatment group: <code>Control</code> or <code>Incentive</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td style="text-align: right;">
    <code>Month7Loss</code></td><td style="text-align: left;"> Weight loss (in pounds) after seven months</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Researchers investigated
whether financial incentives would help people lose weight more successfully. Some participants in
the study were randomly assigned to a treatment group that was offered financial incentives for
achieving weight loss goals, while others were assigned to a control group that did not use financial
incentives. All participants were monitored over a four month period and the net weight change
(Before - After in pounds) at the end of this period was recorded for each individual. Then the
individuals were left alone for three months with a followup weight check at the seven-month mark
to see whether weight losses persisted after the original four months of treatment.<br />
The 4-month data alone (with missing values omitted) is stored in WeightLossIncentive4. <br />
The 7-month data alone (with missing values omitted) is stored in WeightLossIncentive7.
