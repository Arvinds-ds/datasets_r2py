<h2>Video Lottery Terminal Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data on objects appearing in three windows on a video
lottery terminal, together with the prize payout (usually 0).
Observations were taken on two successive days in late 1994
at a hotel lounge north of Winnipeg, Manitoba.  Each observation
cost 25 cents (Canadian).  The game played was &lsquo;Double Diamond&rsquo;.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>vlt</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This data frame contains the following columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>window1</dt><dd><p>object appearing in the first window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>window2</dt><dd><p>object appearing in the second window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>window3</dt><dd><p>object appearing in the third window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>prize</dt><dd><p>cash prize awarded (in Canadian dollars).</p>
</dd>
<dt>night</dt><dd><p>1, if observation was taken on day 1; 2,
if observation was taken on day 2.</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>At each play, each of three windows shows one of 7 possible objects.
Apparently, the three windows are independent of each other, and
the objects should appear with equal probability across the three windows.  
The objects are coded as follows: blank (0), single bar (1), double
bar (2), triple bar (3), double diamond (5), cherries (6), and 
the numeral &quot;7&quot; (7).  
</p>
<p>Prizes (in quarters) are awarded according to the following scheme:  
800 (5-5-5), 80 (7-7-7), 40 (3-3-3), 25 (2-2-2), 10 (1-1-1), 10 (6-6-6),
5 (2 &quot;6&quot;'s), 2 (1 &quot;6&quot;) and 5 (any combination of &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;).
In addition, a &quot;5&quot; doubles any winning combination, e.g. (5-3-3) pays
80 and (5-3-5) pays 160.
