<h2>The Nine Largest Lakes in Manitoba</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>Manitoba.lakes</code> data frame has 9 rows and 2 columns.
The areas and elevations of the nine largest lakes in
Manitoba, Canada.  The geography of Manitoba (a relatively
flat province) can be divided crudely into three main
areas: a very flat prairie in the south which is at a 
relatively high elevation, a middle region consisting
of mainly of forest and Precambrian rock, and a northern
region which drains more rapidly into Hudson
Bay.  All water in Manitoba, which does not evaporate, eventually drains 
into Hudson Bay.
