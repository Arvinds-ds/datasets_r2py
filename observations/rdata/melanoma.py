def melanoma(path):
  """Melanoma skin cancer incidence

  These data from the Connecticut Tumor Registry present age-adjusted
  numbers of melanoma skin-cancer incidences per 100,000 people in
  Connectict for the years from 1936 to 1972.

  A data frame with 37 observations on the following 2 variables.

  year
      Years 1936 to 1972.

  incidence
      Rate of melanoma cancer per 100,000 population.

  Note
  ~~~~

  This dataset is not related to the `melanoma` dataset in the **boot**
  package with the same name.

  The S-PLUS 6.2 help for the melanoma data says that the incidence rate
  is per *million*, but this is not consistent with data found at the
  National Cancer Institute (http://www.nci.nih.gov).
